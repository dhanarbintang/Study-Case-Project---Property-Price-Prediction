# Study Case Project - Property Price Prediction

A Study Case Project of Property Price Prediction

This is a property price prediction using a regression model project.

The dataset used in this project is Bangaluru_House_Data from : https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data

The idea and method of this project are heavily inspired by the following tutor from Dhaval Patel youtube Codebasic (https://www.youtube.com/codebasics).

In this project, I try to add 2 new features which are using area_type and availability, which unfortunately does not increase the accuracy significantly. But it enables users to view the difference of area_type and availability when predicting property price.
